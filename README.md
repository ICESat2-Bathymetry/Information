## What can ICESat-2 do?
The [ICESat-2](https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov) mission is a satellite laser altimeter launched in 2018. Its photon counting lidar makes precise elevation measurements globally, including at high-latitudes. In addition to significant contributions to glaciology and forest mapping, ICESat-2 has proven capable of measuring the depth of the seafloor with sub-meter accuracy, and as deep as 40m in good conditions.

## What's the best way to access ICESat-2 data?
The working group is currently in the process of creating a bathymetric data product. Until then, users should download the geolocated photon data product ATL03 which contains all photon data. We recommend downloading ICESat-2 geolocated photon data either using web based tools like [NSIDC](https://nsidc.org/data/atl03/versions/5) and [OpenAltimetry](https://openaltimetry.org/data/icesat2/), or programmatically with tools like [SlideRule](http://icesat2sliderule.org) and [IcePyx](https://icepyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

For bathymetry focused data downloading tutorials, check out one of the demo notebooks [here](https://github.com/jonm3D/OpenOceans/blob/pkg/is2data/demos/Demo_SlideRule_Interactive_Query.ipynb) or [here](https://github.com/nmt28/C-SHELPh/tree/main/4.Tutorial).

The Science Team also maintains a list of general ICESat-2 tools and services available [here](https://nsidc.org/data/user-resources/help-center/icesat-2-tools-and-services).

## How do I correct depth data for refraction?

Refraction-corrected depths are not currently calculated for existing data, although this will likely be included on a future bathymetric product. The approach outlined in [Parrish, Magruder et al. 2019](https://www.mdpi.com/494326) has been frequently used and validated in research, although [new approaches](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-29-2-2411&id=446584) have been explored in the literature as well.

_Code implementations of Parrish 2019 are available in [Python](https://github.com/ICESat2-Bathymetry/Information/blob/main/code/photon_refraction.py) and [MATLAB](https://github.com/ICESat2-Bathymetry/Information/blob/main/code/refraction_correction_atlas.m)._

The angle of refraction, $\phi$, in the above figure is calculated from Snell's law and requires having a value for $n_2$, which can be computed as described in the [discussion of the refractive index of seawater and freshwater](http://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/parrish/index-refraction-seawater-and-freshwater-function-wavelength-and-temperature#overlay-context=research).

A water surface model (WSM) is also needed, and obtaining a WSM can be one of the more challenging aspects of refraction correction. 

## How do I extract the water surface and seafloor returns?
Photon data can be labeled by hand using the [OpenOceans Manual Classification Tool](https://github.com/jonm3D/OpenOceans) or [PhotonLabeler](https://github.com/Oht0nger/PhoLabeler) tools.

Automated methods of labeling large amounts of data are an open area of research. Which method is best may depend on your use case and desired accuracy.
